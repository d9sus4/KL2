## 1 Categorical variables' case proportions

For all 9 categorical variables remaining after manual selection, here are the proportions of cases:

```
Feature: falls_hx
  No: 26714
  Yes: 13847
  Unknown: 2377
Feature: marital_status
  Unmarried: 20703
  Married: 19766
  Unknown: 2469
Feature: depressed_adm
  0: 31768
  1: 6529
  Unknown: 4641
Feature: payor_primary
  Medicare_FFS: 16063
  Not_listed: 14576
  Medicare_Advantage: 12299
Feature: hispanic
  No: 39745
  Yes: 3193
Feature: sex
  male: 22713
  female: 20225
Feature: stroke_type
  Ischemic: 35805
  Hemorrhagic: 6486
  Other: 647
Feature: low_interest_adm
  0: 33620
  1: 4741
  Unknown: 4577
Feature: race
  White: 29020
  Black_or_African_American: 9838
  Unknown: 2413
  Asian: 1321
  American_Indian_or_Alaska_Native: 176
  Multiracial: 89
  Native_Hawaiian_or_Other_Pacific_Islander: 81
```

We do not see any drastically low proportion case, except for `race`, where we follow [NINDS](https://www.ninds.nih.gov/taxonomy/term/758)'s grouping. It seems we can not reduce these categories any further, especially considering `Multiracial` is one of the smaller-proportion cases, and grouping it with the other few cases does not make sense logically.

## 2 Updated RF global summary trees

## 3 Updated Lasso regression

Increased Lasso CV search of Alpha's grainularity. Now alpha is searched in

```Python
alpha_range = [0.001, 0.05, 0.03, 0.01, 0.5, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5, 10, 50, 100]
```

For selfcare task, the best alpha found by CV is now 0.03.

Following 1-SE rule, for all alpha values that satisfy `mean_error <= min_error + min_error_se`, the largest is 0.1. Fit a new Lasso model on selfcare task with alpha = 0.1 yields the following results:

```
Best alpha (min error): 0.03
Alpha selected by 1SE rule: 0.1

25            bladder_incontinence    -3.203255

```

Now number of variables reduce from 49 to 26.

For the mobility task, 1-SE rule also yields alpha = 0.1, and the results are as follows:

```

## 4 Updated modeling with interaction terms

Now, before creating interaction terms, OT/PT/SLP are combined for week1 and week2 respectively, hence only two combined variables (`sumindweek1` and `sumindweek2`) will be interacting with the rest of the variables.

After adding interaction terms to the data, rerun the forementioned Lasso experiments with 1-SE rule, the results are as follows:
